# ESP32-S3_Particle_CO2_Monitor
ESP32-S3 based Air Quality Particle and CO2 Monitor

This project is another plug in usb-c wall charger type that I find clean, cable free and convenient for my home. It uses an ultra small BMV080 particle sensor that allows for a much smaller project than ever before.
