# ESP32-S3_Particle_CO2_Monitor
ESP32-S3 based Air Quality Particle and CO2 Monitor

This project is another plug in usb-c wall charger type that I find clean, cable free and convenient for my home. It uses an ultra small BMV080 particle sensor that allows for a much smaller project than ever before.

Previous designs used the PMSA003 that used a small fan to draw air in and a laser to detect and count particles via scattering. The new Bosch BMV080 is the worlds smallest particulate matter sensor that is fanless and measures PM2.5 and provides mass concentration data for PM1.0 and PM10.
